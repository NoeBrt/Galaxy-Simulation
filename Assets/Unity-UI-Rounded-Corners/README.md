```
"com.nobi.roundedcorners": "https://github.com/kirevdokimov/Unity-UI-Rounded-Corners.git"
```

### Option 3: Unity Package
Get `.unitypackage` from [releases](https://github.com/kirevdokimov/Unity-UI-Rounded-Corners/releases)

## How to use
#### Symmetrical roundness
- Add `ImageWithRoundedCorners` component to a GameObject with an `Image`
- Adjust `Radius` property
#### Certain roundness value for each corner
- Add `ImageWithIndependentRoundedCorners` to a GameObject with an `Image`
- Adjust `r` Vector4 property. Each vector component represent radius, clockwise, starting with top-left corner
#### Important thing
If you need to add or change the image at runtime, call `Validate()` and then `Refresh()` to update the materials.
