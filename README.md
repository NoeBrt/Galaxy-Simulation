# Galaxies and Universe Simulation 

[Itch Io LINK HERE](https://nosleepnoe.itch.io/galaxy-simulator)

Latest release use GPU computing, in the previous build the Barnes-hut Algorithm was used.

Embark on a cosmic journey with our innovative simulator. Create stunning simulations of various space phenomena and immerse yourself in the breathtaking universe we live in.

Through an intuitive menu interface, users can choose from three types of celestial simulations:

1. A standalone Galaxy
2. Two Galaxies Colliding
3. A broad Universe

The simulator allows users to manipulate various parameters, giving you control over:

- The number of stars (or galaxies)
- The radius of the object being simulated
- The thickness of the galaxy (or galaxies)
- The initial rotation of the stars around the center
- The smoothing length (used to smooth the acceleration of the particles)
- The interaction rate (optimized to improve the framerate)

With the mouse, the user can rotate and zoom in/out around the simulation and use 'B' to toggle the menu.
